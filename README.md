# Gaussian Process Regressor Metallicity Relationship for K and M Dwarfs

This provides the results of a Gaussian Process Regressor (implemented in [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html)) calibrated using photometry and astrometry from [*Gaia*](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr2), [2MASS](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/2mass.html), [AllWISE](http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/) and [Pan-STARRS](https://panstarrs.stsci.edu), as detailed in Medan, Lepine and Hartman (2020). Test.
